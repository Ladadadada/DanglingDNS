# Safe IPs are IP ranges that you own.
# Not an IP owned by another company that you point a DNS record to.
# Not anything that is auto-assigned by another company.
# If who controls the IP can change without you knowing then it doesn't belong here.
# If you relinquish control of the IP and forget to remove it from this file you will get false negatives.
# This list will probably be empty for most people and should be configured last, after all the other safe files.

# The script does not yet support IPv6 but coding in support is in the backlog.
# IPv6 addresses added here won't cause an error but they won't work.

203.0.113.0/24 # A range in CIDR notation.
233.252.0.55   # A bare IPv4 address.
