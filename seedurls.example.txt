# Seed URLs are for domains where the home page does not contain any identifying clues but other pages on the site do.
# If you find that a domain you know is safe is being identified as risky, and there are better paths on that domain that would help DanglingDNS
# do a better job, list them here.
# You can include any URLs for any domains in here.
# If you include multiple URLs for the same domain, DanglingDNS will request all of them. (Not implemented yet.)
# When DanglingDNS is evaluating a domain that exists in this file it will use the paths here instead of the path `/`.
