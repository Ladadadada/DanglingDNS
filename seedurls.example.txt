# Seed URLs are for sites where the home page does not contain any identifying clues but other pages on the site do.
# You can include any URLs for any domains in here.
# If you include multiple URLs for the same domain, DanglingDNS will request all of them. (Not implemented yet.)
# When DanglingDNS is evaluating a domain that exists in this file it will use the paths here instead of /.
