# Safe domains are domains that you use daily or manually check regularly
# Any domain that would be immediately noticed if it was pointing to the wrong place.
# Even dev domains can cause false negatives in here if for instance you decommission
# your staging environment but forget to delete the staging.example.com record.

# example.net
example.com
www.example.com # Canonical domain for the main website
